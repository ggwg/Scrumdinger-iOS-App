# Scrumdinger-iOS-App
*A Scrum manager App for agile software development, written in Swift and develop with Xcode for iOS 12.*

Many software engineering teams use daily meetings, known as scrums, to plan their work for the day. Scrums 
are short meetings where each attendee discusses what they accomplished yesterday, what they are working on 
today, and any obstacles that might impact their work.

Scrumdinger is an iOS app that helps users manage their 
daily scrums. To help keep scrums short and focused, Scrumdinger uses visual and audio cues to indicate 
when and how long each attendee should speak. The app also displays a progress screen that shows the time 
remaining in the meeting and creates a transcript that users can refer to later.

This app is part of Apple's Swift development tutorial.
